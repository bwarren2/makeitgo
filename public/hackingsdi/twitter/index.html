		<p>The feedback on <a href="/hackingsdi/venmo/">Venmo</a> was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;pretty OK!  Your interviewer would probably steer you to the feeds portion, as that is the most interesting.  Look up how twitter is architected and take inspiration from that&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, a brief detour into Twitter.  This is cribbed from <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/7/8/the-architecture-twitter-uses-to-deal-with-150m-active-users.html">High Scalability</a>.</p>
<p>First key insight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Users care about tweets, but the text of the tweet is almost irrelevant to most of Twitter&rsquo;s infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of Twitter&rsquo;s infrastructure is about shuffling IDs around sharded storage.  I read through the linked piece and drew up my understanding of their architecture; I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend this exercise.  If you can&rsquo;t draw something, you don&rsquo;t understand it, and if you can draw it, you probably understand it.</p>
<p><img src="/img/diagrams/Twitter.png" alt="Twitter"></p>
<p>Basically, Twitter is a timeline manufacturing service, and it is mostly an implementation detail what goes in the timeline/that &ldquo;Tweets&rdquo; are involved.</p>
<p>On Tweet, a POST is sent to the load balancer + HTTP response tier (presumably the load balancer is doubled, but I only drew one for simplicity).  That tier creates a tweet in the Tweet service that matches ID to content, I presume that the HTTP tier stuck the tweet in the tweeter&rsquo;s timeline, then the problem of propagation is passed off to Flock.  (I presume the HTTP tier 201&rsquo;s at this point, and the tweeter&rsquo;s request is complete.)</p>
<p>Flock is the social graph portion that knows who follows who; I presume it is partially implemented as a datastore of User =&gt; [Followers], so on tweet the system knows who to update.</p>
<p>However Flock works implementationally, it is responsible for doing a bunch of &ldquo;push tweet into timeline&rdquo; actions, that put the tweet ID in the timelines of people following the person who tweeted.  The lists are 800 tweets long.</p>
<p>When a user gets their timeline, they get to hit an in-memory list of 800 tweets, and the service hydrates the tweets off the tweet store.</p>
<p>Pretty clever, actually.</p>
<h3 id="venmo-feeds">Venmo Feeds</h3>
<p>So how would Venmo feeds of friend transactions work?  The same way as above.  There was nothing special about Tweets; we were just using a list of Person=&gt;Listeners and pushing IDs into a list to by hydrated later.</p>
<h3 id="other-things-i-learned">Other things I learned</h3>
<p>Having to translate a system report into a diagram is super useful.  It calls out the &ldquo;basic molecules&rdquo; of systems design, and makes you think about how to represent what you understand.  I want to start a Menagerie subseries on this blog of the core types of structures I see.  The duplication of Redis consistent hashing boxes above, for example, is intentional; they look the same because fundamentally they are the same.</p>
