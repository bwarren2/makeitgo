		<p>Despite being less talented than many of my classmates, I outscored them on the GRE with a 1590/1600.  I beat or tied people who were demonstrably better suited for grad school than me, because I spent more hours memorizing words for a test.  The GRE was a terrible measure of skill; it mostly measured monomania and resources.</p>
<p>Last week I failed my systems design interview at a FAANG company.  I am most upset at myself and the choices I made, as those determined my outcomes.  But I am second most upset at the system, because afterward I was clued into several of the expectations and practices for passing this interview format.  Similar to the GRE, I learned that performance on this challenge is primarily a function of preparation, practice, access to someone to correct you, and being trained in the odd social dynamic of the test.  That&rsquo;s disappointing for several different reasons, not least among them that it is a test of navigating poorly-socialized material.  (Easy answer: socialize the expectations better.)</p>
<p><strong>Humility is a technologist&rsquo;s virtue, so I am going to recover from this setback the hardest way: publicly</strong>.  Hopefully, it will be of use to others facing similar challenges.</p>
<p>In the Situation, Task, Action, Result framework, the setup is simple:</p>
<p><em>Situation</em>: I failed a significant test.</p>
<p><em>Task</em>: I want to make this test a non-issue for the rest of my life.</p>
<p><em>Action</em>: I will study and chronicle my answers over time, as they start from a bad place and hopefully progress.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the Result will be yet.  But I do know what my stretch goals are.</p>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong>: I indisputably nail these exams and remove them as barriers.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2</strong>: If I am right that systems design interviews measure time and access instead of skill or capacity, I want to make it so straightforward for other people to pass that interviewers and interviewees acknowledge the social fiction of the test.  Ideally, I want enough interviewees to pass with flying colors that interviewers need to recognize they are measuring time, not talent.</p>
<p>Hilariously overambitious <strong>Level 3</strong>: If I am right, and the systems design interview is eventually acknowledged as measuring capacity or skill, I want to see it dislodged from the interview pipeline and replaced with a test with better predictive signal.</p>
<p>I have no idea if this will work.  But tomorrow is the first draft, with a writeup of an SDI problem and feedback from a very accommodating, more-talented friend.</p>
