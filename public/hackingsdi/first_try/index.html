		<p>To get me calibrated, I was given a sample problem to work through in a mock interview: design Parkmobile.  Assume all the towers etc already exist.</p>
<p>I lost the scratchpad I used for that interview.  What follows is the best recollection I have of how it went.</p>
<p>Starting with <strong>identifying functionalities</strong>.  Parkmobile lets people park their cars in designated zones for specific periods of time under a cap. We presume that there is also an API for law enforcement to get data on whether a given car is supposed to be in the current zone at the current time.</p>
<p>Then I defined <strong>entities and relationship</strong>.  I made a simplifying assumption that a given user only has one car registered on parkmobile (which in hazy memory might even be true).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Under prodding, I <strong>identified workflows</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Admins create a bunch of zones</li>
<li>User creates an account</li>
<li>User creates a reservation</li>
<li>Law enforcement passing a car checks the plate to see if it is current.</li>
</ol>
<p>This tells us an <strong>access pattern</strong>: we will need to be able to get things by plate, which will be important later.</p>
<p>Then I defined <strong>api access</strong>.  I focused heavily on CRUD operations.</p>
<pre><code>create_user(...)
get_user(...)
update_user(...)

create_zone(...)
get_zone(...)
update_zone(...)

create_reservation(...)
get_reservation(...)
update_reservation(...)

check_plate(...)
</code></pre><p>Handwaving a bit, I enumerated the attributes of those API calls and called them all &lt;= 500B.  We now start with <strong>sizing and usage assumptions</strong>.</p>
<p>Most of the time, people are not using Parkmobile.  It&rsquo;s mostly useful in cities, and many people in cities are not using it as part of daily life; they drive from home to work and back.</p>
<p>Given that, I think ~1% of the population of the US is using Parkmobile on any given day, usually once or twice.</p>
<p>Making a <strong>market sizing assumption</strong> that we are building for the US and Europe, and that the EU is about as big as the US by population, that means about <em>7 million</em> new reservations per day, distributed throughout the day because of time zones.</p>
<p>Next: <strong>data-sizing napkinmath.</strong>  At ~86K seconds in a day, that is about 81 writes per second.  Handwaving a write as 500B, that means about 45KB of data written per second.  7 million writes/day at 500B/write is 3.5GB of newly-written data per day, or 1.2 TB/year, or 6TB in a 5 year auditing period.  I observed an at-least 5:1 read:write ratio because users and police would check a reservation multiple times even when it is only written once.  This fits in one very large RDS box, but in the actual session I used different assumptions and got a larger number, skewing toward a NoSQL implementation.</p>
<p>I deliberated at length about the appropriate storage of the data.  I broke it up into a storage block (primary and replica) per entity, with the understanding that app servers might make multiple requests to stitch the data together.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I observed that consistent hashing based on the plate of the user could be used to scale the storage blocks as needed and were unlikely to have hotspots.</p>
<p>I added a stateless app tier in front of the storage tier to stitch data together in response to API requests and respond to things like rate limiting.  I added a load balancer in front of the app tier.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Under prompting, I added a cache in front of the LB to reduce redundant access.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And the app tier would need to reach out and invalidate the cache for a plate on any write of a reservation with that plate.  Problem observed by the interviewer: sure we could use least-recently-used, least-frequently-used, time-based, or FIFO eviction strategies.  But is this cache even going to get full?  If 80% of use comes from 20% of users, they will just keep updating the cache with their recent reservation, and it might not even be that large.</p>
<p>The mock interview ended.  I don&rsquo;t think, compared to the broad candidate pool, I did a good job.  But that is why this is the first calibration practice.</p>
<h4 id="things-to-improve-on">Things to improve on</h4>
<ul>
<li>Familiarity with heuristic metrics.  How many connections should I presume possible for a reasonable box?</li>
<li>Intuition for scale.  I should have been able to pick out faster that a standard Django and Postgres implementation would probably work here.</li>
<li>My thinking was muddy about reservation storage and access.  I implicitly was building around only storing one reservation at a time for a user.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="questions-i-have">Questions I have</h4>
<p>In theory, there is a three-dimensional parameter space of number of connections, duration of connection, and result size of query that has a surface of maximum-stable-performance for a given RDS box.  I don&rsquo;t know what that frontier is shaped like.  How many connections, how much throughput, running for how long before the machine is exhausted?  What is this like for a few representative box types?  I don&rsquo;t know, and want to find out.</p>
