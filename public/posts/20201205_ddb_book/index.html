		<h1 id="what-it-is">What it is</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.dynamodbbook.com/">The DynamoDB Book, by Alex Debrie.</a></p>
<h1 id="the-short-version">The Short Version</h1>
<p>This book is excellent.  It is so worth the money.  Get the $80 version and then decide if you want to upgrade.</p>
<h1 id="the-long-version">The Long Version</h1>
<h2 id="what-and-why">What and Why</h2>
<p>This book is Alex Debrie&rsquo;s crystallization of deep knowledge of DynamoDB, with a foreword by certified space wizard Rick Houlihan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alex has invested himself in the subject matter he is presenting here for you in great detail, and he is no doubt a more than capable guide. Open your mind and let this book lead you to that lightbulb moment. - Rick Houlihan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a practical guide to DDB, NoSQL modeling in general, and the nitty-gritty of usage patterns and pitfalls for DDB.  If you are a developer who has mostly lived in the RESTful relational realm, this is a <em>great</em> place to dive in to understanding the other side of the coin.  If you are preparing for Systems Design interviews or thinking about building a data intensive app, this will give you a great home base and formidable guide to set worth with.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-covered">What is covered</h2>
<p>There is a ton of content in here.  This is a brief Table of Contents for the major material.</p>
<h3 id="structure-of-ddb">Structure of DDB</h3>
<p>What are partitions and sort keys etc, how are those partitions managed on boxes, how does consistency manifest in this architecture.</p>
<h3 id="nosql-modeling-patterns">NoSQL Modeling Patterns</h3>
<p>How to handle 1-1, 1-Many, Many-Many relationship modeling under different data volatility scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="example-modeling">Example Modeling</h3>
<p>Alex works several examples with different data requirements to drive home his points.</p>
<h3 id="expressions">Expressions</h3>
<p>Examples and gotchas of all the major expression types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key Condition Expressions</li>
<li>Filter Expressions</li>
<li>Projection Expressions</li>
<li>Condition Expressions</li>
<li>Update Expressions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sorting-and-filtering">Sorting and Filtering</h3>
<p>Each of these have their own chapters of strategies.</p>
<h3 id="batches-and-transactions">Batches and Transactions</h3>
<p>Some of the more recent additions to DDB, supporting multi-object operations with &ldquo;all must succeed&rdquo; and &ldquo;as many as possible&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="cheat-sheets">Cheat Sheets</h2>
<p>Alex does the reader a service by summarizing his own material for easy reference.  Have you ever read a dense book and had to take notes to absorb the material with spaced reinforcement?  This is pre-made.</p>
<h2 id="js--python-cheatsheet">JS + Python Cheatsheet</h2>
<p>For two major languages most developers have at least heard of, the cheatsheet provides code snippets of the major operations.</p>
<h2 id="other-usage-advice">Other Usage Advice</h2>
<p>The little stuff you might stumble over unless advised otherwise is well-handled here.  Things like &ldquo;Filtering won&rsquo;t actually save you from paginating your results, because filtering is a post-data-retrieval step, best for bandwidth control.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="shortcomings">Shortcomings</h2>
<p>There are some things DDB is not designed to do well, especially in the &ldquo;Volatile Many-Many relationships&rdquo; space.  Alex spends some time on the modeling strategies for these, but some of them, like the Materialized Graph section, are a bit brief.  (Alex notes that they are niche when discussing the lack of a deeper example).</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Read this book to be expand your potential as a developer, to understand the strengths and weaknesses of other tools, and to save yourself the heartbreak of having to learn lessons the hard way.</p>
